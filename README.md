# Gene Expression Data Analysis in Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

## Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression data to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model development, and evaluation, with an emphasis on using a neural network approach.

## Data Sources
- **Original Data:** The initial dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comprises gene expression profiles relevant to CRC.
- **Augmented Data:** To enhance the dataset, data augmentation techniques were employed, resulting in a more robust set for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The comprehensive analysis is documented in a Jupyter notebook, which includes code snippets, visualizations, and detailed explanations.

## Methodologies
- **Data Visualization:** Utilized various plots such as pairplots, boxplots, countplots, and correlation heatmaps for an in-depth exploratory analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Developed and evaluated a Decision Tree Classifier and an advanced Neural Network model.
- **Data Augmentation:** Increased the dataset size using bootstrapping methods for a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

## Results
- The Neural Network model achieved an accuracy of 90%, indicating its effectiveness in classifying CRC based on gene expression data.
- Detailed classification reports and model summaries provide insights into the model's performance and decision-making process.

## Repository Contents
- `CRC_Gene_Expression_Data.csv`: Original gene expression dataset from Kaggle.
- `augmented_CRC_data.csv`: Augmented dataset after applying data augmentation techniques.
